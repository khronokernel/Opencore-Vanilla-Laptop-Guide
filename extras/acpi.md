# Getting started with ACPI

## A quick explainer on ACPI and how to make SSDTs

So what are DSDTs and SSDTs? Well, these are tables present in your firmware that outline hardware devices like USB controllers, CPU threads, embedded controllers, system clocks and such. A DSDT(Differentiated System Description Table) can be seen as the body holding most of the info with smaller bits of info being passed by the SSDT(Secondary System Description Table)

> So why do we care about these tables?

macOS can be very picky about the devices present in the DSDT and so our job is to correct it. The main devices that need to be corrected for macOS to work properly:

* Embedded controllers(EC) 
  * All semi-modern intel machines have an EC exposed in their DSDT, with many AMD systems also having it exposed. These controllers are not compatible with macOS so then need to be hidden from macOS and replaced with a dummy EC when running macOS Catalina
* Plugin type
  * This is used to enable native CPU power management on **Intel** Haswell and newer CPUs, the SSDT will connect to the first thread of the CPU. Not meant for AMD
* AWAC system clock.
  * This applies to all 300 series motherboards including Z370 boards, the specific issue is that newer boards ship with AWAC clock enabled. This is a problem because macOS cannot communicate with AWAC clocks, so this requires us to either force on the Legacy RTC clock or if unavailable create a fake one for macOS to play with
* NVRAM SSDT
  * True 300 series motherboards(non-Z370) don't declare the FW chip as MMIO in ACPI and so XNU ignores the MMIO region declared by the UEFI memory map. This SSDT brings back NVRAM support and uses the scope `PCI0.LPCB`, this is the most common scope so a pre-made can be found here: [SSDT-PMC.aml](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/SSDT-PMC.aml) or continue reading and make your own.

## What SSDTs do each platform need

Please see the **specific ACPI section of your config.plist**, all SSDTs needed are covered there with a breif explainer.


# SSDTs: The easy way

So here we'll be using a super simple tool made by CorpNewt: [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)

What this tool does is dumps your DSDT from your firmware, and then creates SSDTs based off your DSDT. **This must be done on the target machine running either Windows or Linux**

So what **can't** SSDTTime do?:

* **Skylake-X/SP/W(X299, C621, C422) SSDTs**: The ACPI is odd on these platforms so manual work is required
* **AWAC and RTC0 SSDTs**: 300 series intel boards will also need to figure his out(Z390 systems are most common for requiring this but some gigabyte Z370 do as well)
* **PMC SSDT**: For fixing 300 series intel NVRAM, a prebuilt for `PCI0.LPCB` can be found here: [SSDT-PMC.aml](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/SSDT-PMC.aml)
* **USBX SSDT**: This is included on sample SSDTs but SSDTTime only makes the SSDT-EC part, Skylake and newer users can grab a prebuilt here: [SSDT-USBX.aml](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/SSDT-USBX.aml)

For users who don't have all the options avaible to them in SSDTTime, you can follow the "SSDTs: The long way" section. You can still use SSDTTime for SSDTs it support for you.

## Running SSDTTime

Run the `SSDTTime.bat` file as Admin on the target machine and you should see something like this:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/456913818467958789/669260286007705623/unknown.png)

What are all these options?:

* `1. FixHPET    - Patch out IRQ Conflicts`
   * IRQ patching, mainly needed for X79, X99 and laptop users
* `2. FakeEC     - OS-aware Fake EC`
   * This is the SSDT-EC, required for Catalina users
* `3. PluginType - Sets plugin-type = 1 on CPU0/PR00`
   * This is the SSDT-PLUG, for Intel only
* `4. Dump DSDT  - Automatically dump the system DSDT`
   * Dumps your DSDT from your firmware


What we want to do is select option `4. Dump DSDT` first, then select the appropriate option(s) for your system. 

> What about USBX?

For Skylake+ and AMD, you can grab a prebuilt file here: [SSDT-USBX.aml](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/SSDT-USBX.aml). This file is plug and play and requires no device configuration, **do not use on Haswell and older**.

**Troubleshooting note**: See [General Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/troubleshooting).md if you're having issues running SSDTTime

## Adding to OpenCore

Don't forget that SSDTs need to be added to Opencore, eminder that .aml is complied, .dsl is code. **Add only the .aml file**:
* EFI/OC/ACPI
* config.plist -> ACPI -> Add

Reminder that Cmd/Crtl+R with ProperTree pointed at your OC folder will add all your SSDTs, kexts and .efi drivers to the config for you. Do not add your DSDT to OpenCore, its already in your firmware


# SSDTs: The long way
SSDTTime doesn't support your platform or wanting to really learn the process of making SSDTs? Well you've come to the right place!


## Getting a copy of our DSDT

So to start, we'll need to get a copy of your DSDT from your firmware. There's a couple of options:

* [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL/releases)
  * Open the app on the target machine(must already be running macOS) and the system's DSDT will show, then File -&gt; SaveAs `System DSDT`. Make sure the file format is ACPI Machine Language Binary(.AML), this will require the machine to be running macOS
  * Do note that all ACPI patches from clover/OpenCore will be applied to the DSDT
* [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)
  * Supports both Windows and Linux for DSDT dumping
  * Option 4 to dump
* [acpidump.exe](https://acpica.org/sites/acpica/files/iasl-win-20180105.zip)
  * In command prompt run `path/to/acpidump.exe -b -n DSDT -z`, this will dump your DSDT as a .dat file. Rename this to DSDT.aml
* F4 in Clover Boot menu
  * DSDT can be found in `EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin`, the folder **must** exist before dumping
* [`acpidump.efi`](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/tree/master/extra-files/acpidump.efi.zip)
  * Add this to `EFI/OC/Tools` and in your config under `Misc -> Tools` with the argument: `-b -n DSDT -z` and select this option in OpenCore's picker. Rename the DSDT.dat to DSDT.aml. Tool is provided by [acpica](https://github.com/acpica/acpica/tree/master/source/tools/acpidump)

If OpenCore is having issues running acpidump, you can call it from the shell with [OpenCoreShell](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCoreShell/releases)(reminder to add to both `EFI/OC/Tools` and in your config under `Misc -> Tools` ):

```text
shell> fs0: // replace with proper drive

fs0:\> dir // to verify this is the right directory

Directory of fs0:\

01/01/01 3:30p EFI

fs0:\> cd EFI\OC\Tools // note that it's with forward slashes

fs0:\EFI\OC\Tools> acpidump.efi -b -n DSDT -z
```

## Compiling and decompiling DSDTs and SSDTs

#### macOS

So compiling DSDTs and SSDTs are quite easy with macOS, all you need is [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL). To compile, just File -&gt; SaveAs -&gt; ACPI Machine Language Binary\(.AML\), decompiling is just opening the file in MaciASL.

#### Windows

Compiling and decompiling on windows is fairly simple though, you will need [iasl.exe](https://acpica.org/sites/acpica/files/iasl-win-20180105.zip) and Command Prompt:

```text
path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.aml
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/IY7HMof.png)

If compiled .aml file is provided, a decompiled .dsl file will be given and vice versa.

#### Linux

Compiling and decompiling with Linux is just as simple, you will need a special copy of [iasl](http://amdosx.kellynet.nl/iasl.zip) and terminal:

```text
path/to/iasl path/to/DSDT.aml
```

If compiled .aml file is provided, a decompiled .dsl file will be given and vice versa.

## Creating SSDTs

### EC SSDT

This one's fairly easy to figure out, open your decompiled DSDT and search for `PNP0C09`. This should give you a result like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/lQ4kpb9.png)

As you can see our `PNP0C09` is found within the `Device (EC0)` meaning this is the device we want to hide from macOS(others may find ). Now grab our SSDT-EC and uncomment the EC0 function(remove the `/*` and `*/` around it):

* [SSDT-EC-USBX](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-EC-USBX.dsl)
  * For Skylake+ and all AMD systems
* [SSDT-EC](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-EC.dsl)
  * For Haswell and older

```text
/* <- REMOVE THIS
External (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.EC0, DeviceObj)

   Scope (\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC0)
   {   
      Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized) // _STA: Status
      {
         If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
         {
            Return (0)
         }
         Else
      {
      Return (0x0F)
     }
  }
}
*/ <- REMOVE THIS
```

But looking back at the screenshot above we notice something, our ACPI path is different: `PC00.LPC0` vs `PCI0.LPCB`. This is very important especially when you're dealing with Intel consumer vs Intel HEDT and AMD, `PC00.LPC0` is common on Intel HEDT while `PCI0.SBRG` is common on AMD. And they even come with name variation such as  `EC0`, `H_EC`, `PGEC` and `ECDV`, so there can't be a one size fits all SSDT, **always verify your path and device**. 

And make sure to scroll to the bottom as the new Fake EC function also need the correct path to replace the old EC. **Do not rename the EC device itself**, this is our fake EC we're using for macOS to play with. Just change the path!

> What happens if multiple `PNP0C09` show up

When this happens you need to figure out which is the main and which is not, it's fairly easy to figure out. Check each controller for the following properties:

* `_HID`
* `_CRS`
* `_GPE`

> What happens if no `PNP0C09` show up?

This means your SSDT can be *almost* complied, the main thing to watch for is whether your DSDT uses `PCI0.LPCB` or not. The reason being is that we have a FakeEC at the bottom of our SSDT that needs to connect properly into our DSDT. Gernally AMD uses `SBRG` while Intel HEDT use `LPC0`, **verify which show up in your DSDT**. Once you find out, change `PCI0.LPCB` to your correct path:

```text
Scope (\_SB.PCI0.LPCB)
{
    Device (EC)
    {
        Name (_HID, "ACID0001")  // _HID: Hardware ID
        Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)  // _STA: Status
        {
            If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
            {
                Return (0x0F)
            }
            Else
            {
                Return (Zero)
            }
        }
    }
}
```


> Hey what about USBX? Do I need to do anything?

USBX is universal across all systems, it just creates a USBX device that forces USB power properties. This is crucial for fixing Mics, DACs, Webcams, Bluetooth Dongles and other high power draw devices. This is not mandatory to boot but should be added in post-install if not before. Note that USBX is only used on skylake+ systems, Broadwell and older can ignore and that USBX requires a patched EC to function correctly

For those who want a deeper dive into the EC issue: [What's new in macOS Catalina](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/den28t/whats_new_in_macos_catalina/)

### PLUG SSDT

**Intel CPUs only**

CPU naming is fairly easy to figure out as well, open your decompiled DSDT and search for `Processor`. This should give you a result like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/U3xffjU.png)

As we can see, the first processor in our list is `PR00`. This is what we'll be applying the `plugin-type=1` property too. Now grab [SSDT-PLUG](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-PLUG.dsl) and replace the default `CPU0` with our `PR00`. Note that there are 2 mentions of `CPU0` in the SSDT.

There are also some edge cases with `Processor`, specifically on HEDT series like X79, X99 and X299. This edge case is that the ACPI path is much longer and not so obvious:

![](https://i.imgur.com/HzOmbx2.png)

If we then search for instances of `CP00` we find that it's ACPI path is `SB.SCK0.CP00`:

![](https://i.imgur.com/CtL6Csn.png)

So for this X299 board, we'd change `\_PR.CPU0` with `\_SB.SCK0.CP00` and `External (_PR_.CPU0, ProcessorObj)` with `External (_SB_.SCK0.CP00, ProcessorObj)`

### AWAC SSDT

**This is required for most B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390 and even some newer BIOS revisions on Z370 like the Gigabyte Z370 Aurus Ultra firmware version 13+** 

What the [SSDT-AWAC](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-AWAC.dsl) will do is force enable the Legacy RTC device in macOS, the reason we want to do this is that macOS currently does not support AWAC as a system clock. In some rare cases, there is no Legacy RTC device to force enable so we'll need to create a fake RTC device for macOS to play with using [SSDT-RTC0](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-RTC0.dsl)

To determine whether you need [SSDT-AWAC](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-AWAC.dsl) or [SSDT-RTC0](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-RTC0.dsl), open your decompiled DSDT and search for `Device (AWAC)`. If you get a result then you have an `AWAC` system clock present, **if nothing shows then no need to continue and no need for this SSDT**. Otherwise, continue with the next search for `STAS ==`:

![](https://i.imgur.com/uuUF857.png)

As you can see we found the `STAS ==` in our DSDT, this means we're able to force enable our Legacy RTC. In this case, [SSDT-AWAC](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-AWAC.dsl) will be used As-Is with no modifications required. Just need to compile.

For systems where no `STAS` shows up but you do have `AWAC`, you can use [SSDT-RTC0](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-RTC0.dsl) though you will need to check whether your DSDT uses `LPCB`, `LBC` or `LBC0`. By default it uses `LPCB`, you can check by just searching for instances of `LPCB`, `LBC` and `LBC0` in your DSDT

### PMC SSDT

**This is required for all B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390 motherboards**
This SSDT brings back NVRAM support and uses the scope `PCI0.LPCB` to check what scope your system has, search your DSDT for `Name (_ADR, 0x001F0000)`. This address is used for Low Pin Count devices(LPC) but the device name can vary(quite rarely in reality, almost all consumer intel boards use `LPCB`)

## Cleaning up

Now that we have all our SSDTs compiled, the last thing to do is add our SSDTs to both EFI/OC/ACPI and our config under ACPI -&gt; Add. A reminder that ProperTree users can press the hotkey Cmd/Ctrl+R for automatically adding your SSDTs to the config. A reminder that there is no need to add your DSDT as its already inside your firmware.
