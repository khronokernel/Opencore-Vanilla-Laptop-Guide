# Legacy Install

Last editied: January 27, 2020

Wanna try OpenCore but can't boot UEFI based sources? Well don't fret, there's hope for you! OpenCore supports DuetPkg which emulates a UEFI environment for legacy systems.

To start, you need the following:

* BootInstall.command
* Install source(MacOS Journaled + GUID, size of USb depends on the version of macOS. 16GB recommended for catalina)

Within your OpenCore build folder, navigate to `Utilities/BootInstall`. Here you'll find a file called `BootInstall.command`. What this does is install DuetPkg to your desired drive.

Now you'll want to run `BootInstall.command`, do note that you may need `sudo` for this to work correctly on newer versions of macOS

sudo Utilities/BootInstall/BootInstall.command
```

This will give you a list of available disks, choose yours and you will be prompted to write a new MBR. Choose yes`[y]` and you'll be finished.

This will provide you with an EFI partition with a `boot` file, this is where we'll add our OpenCore EFI.

**Note**: You will need [AppleUsbKbDxe](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).efi for picker support
